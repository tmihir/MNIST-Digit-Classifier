# MNIST-Digit-Classifier

* Extracted digit image classification data and created view for digit image
* Implemented logistic classifcation and fetched probability based value
* Used softmax function to get the maximum accuracy
* Compred performance with Bagging algorithm
* Developed Bagging algorithm using randomly generated trees and their output
* Classified digit and identified accuracy using confusion matrix
